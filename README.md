This project was created for One week Hackathon. 

## Idea: Location based Ads 

* Summary: 
        Small-Medium scale businesses (SMB) cant target customer nearby by pushing ads to their devices. Idea is to creating generic ads base system, but due to unavailability of time we targeted SMB Restaurents.User (Mobile app user) can install this app and save his/her preferences to get desired notification. SMB Restaurant with similar preference can see the number of users around themare interest in the type of food Restaurant is serving.SMB Restaurants can send create dynamic offer (real-time) and can send notification to attract them.
        
* Future: 
        * Can integrate with yelp apis, to show restaurant ratings
        * Can provide QR code in mobile app, so that restaurant can scan and save information about Mobile User in customer base
        * Mobile App for SMB Restaurants 
        *Paid subscription for restaurant users to send more notifications and increase raidus of targeted mobile users
